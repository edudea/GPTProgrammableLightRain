# Light Rain Mediator

Light rain is a space of light stips hanging like curtains. The light rain mediator offers a website where people can
describe how the light stips shall blink. The user's description is translated by a language model into source code.

Requirements for the light rain mediator are
* access to a chat bot API
* LED light strips with Arduino attached

The project accesses a chat bot via API to translate the user's description into c++ for the Arduino.
